            We use only a limited number of technologies needed to operate the website, remember
            privacy choices, protect embedded forms, and understand website performance in an
            aggregated, privacy-friendly way.
          </p>

          <h2>What are cookies and similar technologies?</h2>
          <p>
            Cookies are small text files that a website or third-party service may store in your
            browser. Websites may also use browser technologies such as local storage to save
            limited information on your device.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some technologies are strictly necessary for a website or a requested service to
            function. Other technologies may be used for analytics, personalization, or marketing.
            Technologies that are not strictly necessary are activated only where an appropriate
            legal basis exists and, when required, after you have given consent.
