## 1. Brand Basics

- **Brand name:** SparkLifeLab
- **Tagline:** Ignite Your Best Life — On Purpose
- **Domain:** spark-life-lab.com
- **Substack:** https://sparklifelab.substack.com/

- **Founders:** Bärbel Tress (BT), Gunther Tress (GT), Scott E. Burton (SB)

- **Logo:** TODO — confirm with Bärbel Tress

### Brand Positioning

SparkLifeLab is a calm, guided space for people in midlife who sense that something in their life no longer quite fits, even if everything looks fine from the outside.

The brand frames midlife as:

- a threshold
- a crossing
- a signal
- a realignment
- not a crisis
- not a failure
- not a clinical diagnosis

### Tone

Use language that is:

- calm
- reflective
- mature
- human
- warm
- emotionally precise
- honest
- grounded
- non-clinical
- non-hype

Avoid language that feels:

- aggressive
- motivational-hype
- therapy-clinic
- corporate
- generic coaching
- spiritual cliché
- SaaS/startup-like
- overpromising
- urgent or fear-based

## 3. Imagery Requirements

Use only 3–4 images total unless there is a strong reason.

| Section | Image | Requirement |
|---|---|---|
| Hero | Yes | Right column landscape image. Wide-angle landscape, warm golden light, calm, small figure(s). |

**Founder assignment:**

- Bärbel Tress = `founder_barbel.png`
- Gunther Tress = `founder_gunther.png`
- Scott E. Burton = `founder_scott.png`

**Implementation note:** Founder images must appear cleanly circular. Do not show unwanted square frames. Use `border-radius: 50%`, `object-fit: cover`, and overflow handling as needed.

- `landscape-01.jpeg`

Hero image should appear in the right column of the hero section.

**Tagline:** Must not appear here.

A guided space for midlife clarity

## SECTION 2 — The Problem / The Midlife Fog

**Goal:** Name the problem and make the visitor feel seen.  
**Background:** `#1B3A6B`  
**Text:** white  
**Tone:** Calm. Never crisis. Use threshold/signal framing.

### Approved Copy

**Eyebrow:**  
What you’re experiencing has a name.

**Heading:**  
The Midlife Fog

**Body:**  
There is a moment many people reach in midlife — quietly, without drama. The day has been full. Life is working, by most measures. And yet, when things go still, something feels slightly off. Not broken. Just… no longer quite yours.

What you are experiencing has a name. At SparkLifeLab, we call it the Midlife Fog — the phase when old clarity begins to soften and a new direction has not yet formed. Familiar roles feel constraining. Old motivations feel thinner. Something new is trying to emerge, but it is not yet clear.

This is not a crisis. It is not a sign that something has gone wrong.

**Closing pull quote:**  
It is a signal — that your life is ready to realign with who you are becoming now.

---

## SECTION 3 — About SparkLifeLab + Founders

**Goal:** Establish SparkLifeLab as guide: empathy first, authority second.  
**Background:** `#FEFDF8`  
**Structure:** SLL positioning → Founders’ story → Founder cards

### Approved Copy

**Eyebrow:**  
We’ve walked this path ourselves.

**Heading:**  
A calm, guided space to regain orientation

**SLL Positioning:**  
SparkLifeLab exists for people in midlife who sense that something in their life no longer fits — even if, from the outside, everything looks fine. We exist because midlife deserves a more thoughtful, humane framing — as a meaningful threshold where experience, longing, and possibility meet.

Feeling stuck or uncertain is not a flaw. It is often a signal that growth is asking for attention. We don’t promise quick fixes or dramatic reinvention. We walk alongside people as guides — offering structure, reflection, and companionship as they find their own direction forward.

**Founders heading:**  
Why we built SparkLifeLab

**Founders subheading:**  
We’re fellow travellers — not experts standing apart.

**Founders’ story:**  
SparkLifeLab began with a quiet question many people reach in midlife: Is this really it — or is something else trying to emerge?

The three of us — Bärbel, Gunther, and Scott — met during an online course on life purpose. None of us was in a difficult place. Our careers were established, our lives looked solid and successful from the outside. Yet each of us felt a growing sense that the stories we were living no longer quite fit. Something had shifted — subtle, persistent, hard to name.

What helped us most wasn’t quick advice or ready-made solutions, but the chance to slow down together. Space, time, and companionship. Conversations that didn’t rush us toward answers, but helped us listen more closely to what mattered now. Gradually, clarity emerged.

We realised this wasn’t a personal failure. It was a threshold — a meaningful crossing many people reach in midlife, often alone and without support. SparkLifeLab grew from the wish that something like this had existed when we first felt that quiet restlessness. We’re still on that path ourselves — and we’re glad to walk it with you.

**Background:** `#1B3A6B`

**Heading:**  
The Midlife Clarity Check

**Subheading:**  
A free self-assessment to help you understand where you are — and what may be ready to change.

Six honest questions. Your answers reveal exactly where you are in the Midlife Fog.

In around 20–30 minutes, you will:

- Recognise the signals that something in your life is ready to shift

- Receive a personalised reflection based on your answers

In a small, supported group, you will explore your values, your strengths, and the direction that feels most aligned with who you are becoming. Not a course. Not coaching.

A guided crossing — with others who understand what this passage feels like.

The journey ends with your personal IdentityMap: a beautifully designed document that brings together everything you discovered — your values, strengths, purpose, and emerging future. A compass you keep.
